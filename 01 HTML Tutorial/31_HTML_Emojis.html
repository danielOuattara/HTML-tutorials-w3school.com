        <h1>Using Emojis in HTML</h1>


<!-- Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗


What are Emojis ?
==================

Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) alphabet.

NOTE. UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
----


The HTML charset Attribute
===========================

To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set
used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:

<meta charset="UTF-8">

NOTE: If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.
----


UTF-8 Characters
=================

Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always
be displayed using numbers, called "entity numbers":

  >  A is 65
  >  B is 66
  >  C is 67                                                                 -->

<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>


<!-- The <meta charset="UTF-8"> element defines the character set.

The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67.

To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must
start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon).


Emoji Characters
=================

Emojis are also characters from the UTF-8 alphabet:

    😄 is 128516
    😍 is 128525
    💗 is 128151                                                           -->



<h3>My First Emoji</h3>

<!-- Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and
sized just like any other character in HTML.-->

<h3>Sized Emojis</h3>

<p style="font-size:48px"> &#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151;</p>

The @charset CSS Rule
======================

You can use the CSS @charset rule to specify the character encoding used
in a style sheet:


Set the encoding of the style sheet to Unicode UTF-8:

@charset "UTF-8";
